## 3. Relevant Experience

1. **Capacity per Unit-Energy under Covert Constraint in Fading Channels**  
   Extracted capacity per unit cost for slow fading channels under covert constraints; established lower bounds on eavesdropperâ€™s error probability to improve system      reliability and confidentiality.

2. **Pipelined Implementation of 32-bit RISC Processor**  
   Designed and optimized pipeline stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back) in Verilog, and created test benches to validate performance and functionality.

3. **RTL Implementation of Parameterized FIFO**  
   Developed a configurable FIFO buffer in Verilog with customizable depth, verified via test benches and waveform analysis for design reliability.

4. **Real-Time Binary Pattern Detection Algorithm**  
   Implemented a Moore FSM in Verilog to detect overlapping/non-overlapping binary patterns; simulated and validated architecture using D-Flip Flops.
